# Balance & Economy (Starter)

## Weekly hours
- Baseline hours per member from route config
- Typical available_hours team-wide: 18–28 (route dependent)

## Fatigue
- Training session adds fatigue:
  - drill: +6
  - mock_service: +10
  - plating_run: +7
  - hygiene_theory: +3
  - fundraiser_cook: +9
- Weekly recovery baseline: -10 (modified by cohesion)

## Sponsorship
- Sponsor fallthrough risk increases when reputation < 20 and budget < 500
- Typical payouts:
  - micro: 150–300
  - small: 400–800
  - major: 1200–2500
Route sponsor_difficulty affects chance, not payout.

## Conflict
- Conflict chance increases when fatigue > 65 or cohesion < 45
- Relationship < -30 greatly increases conflict trigger probability

## Catch-up mechanics
If player has 2 bad weeks in a row:
- Offer “mentor intervention” mission (restores morale, reduces fatigue)
- Offer “community fundraiser” mission (budget boost but costs hours)
