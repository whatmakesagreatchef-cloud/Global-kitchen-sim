# Conflict Playbook

## Conflict types
1) Hierarchy clash (roles, authority, station ownership)
2) Ego clash (credit, leadership, control)
3) Communication clash (direct vs indirect)
4) Standards vs speed (timing vs perfection)
5) Creativity vs tradition (plating/identity disputes)

## Trigger drivers
- fatigue > 60
- cohesion < 50
- relationship score < -20
- FLAG_FAVOURITISM, FLAG_RUSHED_PREP, missed training

## Resolution tools (player choices)
- Mediation: costs time, improves cohesion/relationships
- Role clarity: reduces future conflict probability
- Rest week: reduces fatigue, slower readiness growth
- Discipline: improves workflow short-term, morale cost
- Mentor intervention: reputation + cohesion boost, may cost budget

## Consequences
- Unresolved conflict increases penalty risk on competition day
- Resolved conflict grants “clutch bonus” chance (consistency under pressure)
