# Narrative Bible (Career Story Mode)

## Narrative promise
Every route teaches a different truth about competition life: systems, culture, funding realities, and human dynamics — without making any route “the correct way.”

## Season spine (shared across all countries)
- CH1 Tryouts & Team Build (Weeks 1–2)
- CH2 Funding Reality (Weeks 3–4)
- CH3 Training Grind (Weeks 5–8)
- CH4 Setback Week (Week 9)
- CH5 Qualifiers (Week 10)
- CH6 Nationals/Showcase (Week 12)
- Epilogue: Season Review & Legacy

## Country route goal
A route is a “campaign lens.” Same chapter structure, different:
- mission writing and choices
- event probabilities (conflict types)
- economy (budget/sponsors)
- scoring bias (rubric multipliers)
- constraints (time, travel, facilities)

## Character archetypes (reusable globally)
- The Prodigy (high potential, volatile)
- The Station Rock (reliable, low drama)
- The Artist (plating/creativity, hates structure)
- The Classicist (tradition, critique-heavy)
- The Grinder (works long hours, fatigue risk)
- The Influencer (brand/reputation buff, ego risk)

## Recurring NPC roles (non-playable)
- Mentor Chef (boosts training; pushes standards)
- Sponsor Contact (funding gate; reputation checks)
- Rival Manager (pressure + morale swings)
- Federation/Org Rep (rule changes, logistics constraints)

## Conflict philosophy
Conflict is never “flavour text.” It must:
- cost something (time, morale, readiness)
- offer a leadership choice (mediate, structure roles, rest, discipline)
- change relationship scores and future event chances
