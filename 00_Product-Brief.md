# Product Brief

## Working title
**Global Kitchen: Team Manager (Career Mode)**

## One-line pitch
Choose a country route and manage a competition team through training, funding pressure, interpersonal conflict, and high-stakes cook-offs — learning how different cultures and systems shape performance.

## Target users
- Coaches / lecturers / mentors (training realism)
- Competitors/apprentices (learning pressure + workflow)
- Food community / sponsors (impact storytelling)

## Platform

## Core player fantasy
“I built this team from nothing, kept them together under pressure, found funding, trained smart, and performed on the day.”

## Core loop (weekly)
Plan → Select missions → Resolve outcomes → Handle events/conflict → Compete → Debrief → Improve
